# wine-Quality-Prediction
## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning techniques.
The dataset contains various chemical attributes of red/white wines, and the goal is to classify/predict the quality score given by wine tasters.

By building ML models, we can automate wine quality assessment,
